    <p class="text-muted">The Tanglin Pool is an important part of the campus as swimming is a big thing in the school. The Tanglin Swimming team, known as the "Merlions" consist of some of the most talented young swimmers. However not only the Merlions use the pool, it is also a PE venue. Every Tanglin Student has swimming as one of their PE topics every year. We believe that swimming is an important skill for our students to learn. </p>
